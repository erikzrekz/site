        			üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I also have a great deal of respect for communications, computers, and internet technologies, and so sometimes I don't always consider "work" work. If that makes sense.

        	<em>Identify all your feedback loops</em>
        	<section>
        		<p>
        			While we could get into the philosophy of a world without cause and effect, in an objective reality, cause and effect exists for all of us in a business setting. 
        		</p>

        	<section>
        		<p>
        			When you're working in a remote environment, just by yourself, it's hard to know if you're always doing the right thing, or if others are working too, or if what you found should be shared right this second or later.
        		</p>
        	</section>
        	<section>
        		<p>That's why a critical look at the causal relationships between you, your colleagues, your work, your manager, and your career is extra important.</p>
        	</section>
        	<section class="mt">
        		<p>So make sure to:</p>
        		<ul>
        			<li class="fragment">Ask what methods of communication are best</li>
        			<li class="fragment">Understand the quality of your inputs</li>
        			<li class="fragment">Set expectations about your understanding of the feedback process</li>

        	<h2>Lessons Learned 2Ô∏è‚É£</h2>
        	<em>Become an information expert</em>
        	<section>
        		<p>
					As an employee of the modern age, information and knowledge is currency. In a remote setting, you actually get new levers that you didn't have before as a knowledge worker.  
        		</p>
        	</section>
        	<section>
        		<p>
        			Because the physical nature of the office is removed, you get a lot of flexibility and time back. These are also incredibly powerful resources that can increase ones ability to obtain information and knowledge.
        		</p>
        	</section>
        	<section>
        		<p>
        			So consider for a second, what information makes your work important? Easier? More valuable? 
        		</p>
        	</section>
        	<section>
        		<p>
        			How do you maintain that information? In your memory? Or somewhere else? 
        		</p>
        	</section>
        	<section class="mt">
        		<p>So my suggestions are to:</p>
        		<ul>
        			<li class="fragment">Write down what information is most important to your job AND your career</li>
        			<li class="fragment">Create a personal system of mental, analog, and digital information storage</li>
        			<li class="fragment">Talk with your colleagues about their information storage systems and create shared repositiories of knowledge</li>
        			<li class="fragment">Understand the importance of synchronous and asynchronous information sharing</li>
        		</ul>

        	<em>Maximize how you use the internet</em>
        	<section>
        		<p>
					No, this doesn't mean improving your bandwidth or internet speed.  
        		</p>
        	</section>
        	<section>
        		<p>
        			This means getting really good at using your computer, online.
        		</p>
        	</section>
        	<section>
        		<p>
        			And this does NOT mean you have to learn to program.
        		</p>
        	</section>
        	<section>
        		<p>
        			So what does this mean?
        		</p>
        	</section>
        	<section class="mt">
        		<p>It means:</p>
        		<ul>
        			<li class="fragment">Learn how to type faster</li>
        			<li class="fragment">Before asking a question to someone else via email or text, try searching around for the answer</li>
        			<li class="fragment">Find online communities that pique your interest and engage</li>
        			<li class="fragment">Stay informed about how the internet is evolving</li>
