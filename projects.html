			<h1>Other Projects</h1>
			<p>I like working on weekend and evening projects that are about community, infrastructure, education, or heritage.</p>

			<h2>Mixed Media</h2>
		
			<p><span>2018 - Present</span>. After moving to New Orleans, I developed a friend group at The Blue House, a cooperative work space. Wheels started to turn on ways that we could engage the public with civic issues using mediums such as painting, photography, collages, weaving, and music. We partnered with several local architecture, engineering, and public activist groups, and we were published several times in the local daily, The Advocate.</p>

				<li><a href="https://issue2.mxd.media">Issue 2: Water Systems</a></li>
			</ul>

			<p><em>Flask and Vue.js on AWS</em></p>

			<h2>The MƒÅksla Group</h2>
			<p><span>2018 - Present</span>. My brothers and I have been working on heritage preservation project since we visited Latvia 2 years ago. We grew up with half our family Latvian and we find, like I think most who encounter the small Baltic country, the history and culture unique and different. Not to mention our great grandfather was a famous painter.</p>

			</ul>

			<h2>Designers & Geeks</h2>
			<p><span>2016 - 2017</span>. With the help of my colleage Joe, I partnered up with some folks at Education First in Cambridge and hosted several Designers & Geeks events. I mostly emcee'd, made sure everyone had a good time, and tried to connect folks.</p>

			</ul>

			<h2>Open IDEO</h2>
			<p><span>2016</span>. Some friends from Arnold Worldwide and I entered into an Open IDEO competition with an idea that we thought might be able to solve the financial challenges that students face when negotiating college tuition prices.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://challenges.openideo.com/profiles/10205006742668568/teams#team-membership">UnBroke Project Details</a></li>
			</ul>

			<h2>OS Zendesk</h2>
			<p><span>2015 - 2017</span>. As a Tools Engineer for Circle, I spent a lot of time and effort creating deep integrations between our backoffice tools and Zendesk. In order to keep pace with our integrations requirements, I contributed to a popular node.js Zendesk client library often enough that I became a primary maintainer. In doing so I became exceptionally familiar with their APIs and featureset. Before Zendesk added their own dashboarding tool for agents, I built our team a custom one and open-sourced around the same time.

			</ul>

			<p><em>node.js on Heroku/AWS</em></p>

			<h2>Tapbooty</h2>
			<p><span>2014</span>. Before they were the founders of Crayon, Jonah and John needed some customer support and business development assistance for a Facebook game they were maintaining called Tapbooty. It's no longer supported.</p>

			</ul>

			<h2>Dzejnieks</h2>
			<p><span>2013</span>. While I was working as a substitute teacher in New York City, I spent my time writing short stories for friends and family. The story was about a young kid on a farm, trying to convince his father and uncles that he was ready for the world. "Dzejnieks" in Latvian means, poet.</p>
