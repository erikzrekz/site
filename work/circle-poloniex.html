			<h1>Work Samples from Circle/Poloniex</h1>

			<h2>CCXT Partnership</h2>
			<div class="row row-row">
				<div>
					<p><span>2019</span>. Worked on a partnerships with the CCXT team, involving Poloniex's trading & wallet APIs. A large part of the effort also included rewriting the <a href="https://docs.poloniex.com/#introduction">API documentation</a>.</p>

			<h2>Bank Wires on Poloniex</h2>
			<div class="row row-column">
				<div>
					<p><span>2019</span>. One of the biggest features we worked on in 2019 was an integration between Circle's USDC APIs and Poloniex. It was slowly rolled out to customers who sought the ability to purchase large sums of USDC and remain protected from price volatility until they were ready to trade. This feature was an early step towards what was later released as a <a href="https://developers.circle.com/docs/circle-payments-api-quickstart">full-blown API solution</a> for businesses at the beginning of 2020.</p>

			<h2>Circle Invest Research</h2>
			<div class="row row-row">
				<div>
					<p><span>2018</span>. Before Circle was ready to fully acquire Poloniex, I spent a large portion of my time getting to know the Circle Invest product and supporting that team with customer research efforts. We spent several months engaged with stakeholders, speaking with a variety of prospective customers and developing persona profiles, and assisting in the content creation process that would later become Circle Invest's embedded Token Story feature.</p>

			<h2>Circle Pay Cross Border Payments</h2>
			<div class="row row-row">
				<div>
					<p><span>2017</span>. After Circle Pay removed Bitcoin, we iterated over several features that brought us moderate adoption success in the UK and Europe. The vision for this feature was on-par with <a href="https://cash.app/help/us/en-us/3056-sent-payments-international">what Square Cash later released in 2019</a> with their GBP functionality. In some ways, we were ahead of the curve and lacked the business model to really make it a long lasting success.</p>

			<h2>Internal Risk Engine UI</h2>
			<div class="row row-column">
				<div>
					<p><span>2016 - 2017</span>. Working as a quasi-PM and full stack engineer with our Risk and Engineering team, I managed, designed, and developed the UI that our Data Science team used to handle fraudulent transactions, KYC triggers, and other cases that required synchronous/asynchronous decision making.</p>
					<p>What's shown below is a feature that allowed for data science models to be tested in certain contexts.</p>

						<li><span>Tech:</span> Angular, node.js on AWS</li>

			<h2>OS Zendesk</h2>
			<div class="row row-column">
				<div>
					<p><span>2015 - 2017</span>. I spent a lot of time and effort creating deep integrations between our backoffice tools and Zendesk. In order to keep pace with our integrations requirements, I contributed to a popular node.js Zendesk client library often enough that I became a primary maintainer. In doing so I became exceptionally familiar with their APIs and featureset. Before Zendesk added their own dashboarding tool for agents, I built our team a custom one and open-sourced around the same time.

			<h2>Circle Help Center</h2>
			<div class="row row-column">
				<div>
					<p><span>2014 - 2016</span>. As an early member of the CX team, I managed, designed, and developed the Zendesk Help Center to support all of our Circle customers. I became deeply involved with Zendesk integrations that led to me to contributing to open source libraries and furthering integrations within our own tech ecosystem.</p>
