			<h1>Other Work</h1>

			<h2>The Māksla Group</h2>
			<p><span>2018 - Present</span>. My brothers and I have been working on a Baltic heritage preservation project since we visited Latvia 2 years ago. We grew up with half our family Latvian and we find, like I think most who encounter the small Baltic country, the history and culture of Latvia charming, unique and different. Not to mention our great grandfather was a famous painter and has been a source of creative inspiration to us over the years.</p>

			<h2>Open IDEO</h2>
			<div class="row row-row">
				<div>
					<p><span>2016</span>. Some friends from Arnold Worldwide and I entered into an Open IDEO competition with an idea that we thought might be able to solve the financial challenges that students face when negotiating college tuition prices.</p>

			<h2>Tapbooty</h2>
			<div class="row row-row">
				<div>
					<p><span>2014</span>. Before they were the founders of Crayon, Jonah and John needed some customer support and business development assistance for a social rewards Facebook game they were maintaining called Tapbooty. It's sadly no longer supported.</p>

			<h2>Dzejnieks</h2>
			<p><span>2013</span>. While I was working as a substitute teacher in New York City, I spent my time writing short stories for friends and family. The story was about a young kid on a farm, trying to convince his father and uncles that he was ready for the world. "Dzejnieks" in Latvian means, poet.</p>
