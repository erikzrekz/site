			<h1>Work from Mixed Media</h1>

			<h2>Mixed Media Issue #2</h2>
			<div class="row row-column">
				<div>
					<p><span>2018 - Present</span>. After solid reception of our first issue, we spent over 4 months working with New Orlean's water utility, SWBNO, local artists, and pump station operators, to create a body of work that told the story of what it takes to keep pump stations going before, during, and after storms. New Orleans is a sinking city and it relies heavily on the water pumping infrastructure to keep communities safe and dry. The reception to this work exceeded our expectations, as the stories gave water utility operators a platform to stand on.</p>

			<h2>Mixed Media Issue #1</h2>
			<div class="row row-column">
				<div>
					<p><span>2018 - Present</span>. After moving to New Orleans, I developed a friend group at The Blue House, a cooperative work space. Wheels started to turn on ways that we could engage the public with civic issues using mediums such as painting, photography, collages, weaving, and music. We partnered with several local architecture, engineering, and public activist groups, and we were published several times in the local daily, The Advocate.</p><p>Our first issue was on the topic of incarceration in our community, the effects it has on families and loved ones, and who is waiting to help those trying to re-assimilate into society.</p>
